                                            a Washington Post article detailing morale issues across the
                                        organization, the paper's sources told it Meta has a problem with new Quest
                                        owners only using the headsets for a few weeks.
Additionally, consumers who use the devices also migrated to third-party virtual
                                        reality apps instead of Horizon Worlds, the tech firm's own VR app.

                                        A former employee critical of the company said it built multiple devices and had
                                        teams working on multiple versions of existing hardware concurrently since it
                                        ramped up development and research following its acquisition of Oculus in 2014.
                                    

                                        "It was built like a software company that was trying to experiment instead of a
                                        mature hardware company that was trying to build hardware," one former employee
                                        said.
                                    

                                        In February, the company reported that its VR division posted an operating
                                            loss of $13.7 billion for 2022.
                                    
Then in March, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that layoffs would hit the company
                                        with 10,000 employees by the end of the year,
                                        following the 11,000 roles that
                                            were cut in November of 2022.
