Monster Hunter and Resident Evil have helped Capcom deliver record net sales
                                            and profits. 
According to the company's fiscal report for the year ended March 31,
                                            2023, consolidated net sales increased by 14.4 percent year-on-year to 125.9
                                            billion yen ($934.4 million). Profits increased by 12.9 percent to 36.7
                                            billion yen ($272.4 million) over the same period, marking a
                                            decade of consecutive operating income growth. 
Capcom said that performance was driven by the "significant" contributions
                                            key franchises such as Monster Hunter and Resident Evil. For instance,
                                            Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak has achieved 5.45 million sales since
                                            launching in June 2022, while Resident Evil 4 (Remake) has sold
                                            3.75 million units to date. 
Digging deeper into the Japanese publisher's Digital Contents business, which
                                            houses its video game operations, Capcom said it delivered game sales
                                            of 41.7 million units, representing a significant increase on the 32.6
                                            million units it sold last year.
Catalog titles played their part by achieving sales of 29.3 million units–an
                                            increase on the 24 million units sold the previous year. Digital sales also
                                            received a shot in the arm thanks to strategic marketing and promotions,
                                            rising to 37.3 million units from 24.6 million units.
Looking ahead, Capcom is forecasting consolidated net sales of 140 billion
                                            yen and profits of 40 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024.
                                        
Notably, the company wants to deliver a consumer sub-segment sales record of
                                            45 million units by growing catalog titles sales and launching new games
                                            including Street Fighter 6 and Exoprimal—the latter of
                                            which is a brand new franchise.
In the long-term, Capcom believes it will eventually be capable of
                                            achieving 100 million annual unit sales (as shown below), but didn't say
                                            when, precisely, it expects to realize that lofty goal.
