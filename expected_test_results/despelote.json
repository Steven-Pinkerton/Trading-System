Developers Juli\u00e1n Cordero and Sebasti\u00e1n Valbuena chart a\n                                        semi-autobiographical experience of their childhood in 2001's Ecuador, right\n                                        before their football team qualified for its first-ever World Cup. After\n                                        disappearing for a while the devs have now announced a partnership with indie\n                                        publisher Panic to help release Despelote next year. Watch its re-reveal trailer\n                                        below, please, it's beautiful.\nThe first-person slice-of-lifer explores football's impact on the city of Quito,\n                                        or rather its impact on the people who lived there as excitement bubbled and\n                                        kicking balls was a way to come together. You\u2019ll be running around the\n                                        city, dribbling balls, playing games with other kids, and generally having a\n                                        super chill time exploring stuff, by the looks of it.\nAnd boy oh boy, Despelote is a looker. The distinctive style was created from\n                                        reference photos, as well as \u201cactual textures captured on-site in\n                                        Quito,\u201d according to Panic\u2019sblogabout the game. The same technique was used for the audio too. The city\u2019s\n                                        ambient soundscape was mostly recorded on location, from the cicada\u2019s\n                                        chirps to the mumbles of passersby. The game\u2019s also fully voiced in\n                                        Spanish, for an extra level of authenticity.\nEverything here has a painfully nostalgic, almost hazy dreamlike feeling that I\n                                        love. And theming the game around football culture is a really smart move.\n                                        I\u2019m a terrible footballer, but I do love watching people play, and talk\n                                        about, and bond over football. Total strangers become instant pals when asked\n                                        about their favourite teams. I\u2019ve moved past language barriers with family\n                                        by kicking a silly little plastic ball. It\u2019s kind of beautiful.\nBasically, I\u2019m very excited to soak in the game\u2019s one-of-a-kind\n                                        atmosphere. Despelote is coming to PC viaSteam,\n                                        Xboxes, and PlayStations in 2024. The game's also featured as an official\n                                        selection for this year\u2019s Tribeca Games program, so we might see more from\n                                        Despelote this summer."
